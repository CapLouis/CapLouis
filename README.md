### I'm Paul, working on programming soups ;) .

**Paul-Thorel/Paul-Thorel** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python projects (some minor ones)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced CSS to improve my designs..
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about your projects, I'll try helping you!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Check YouTube : TutoDev ...


- âš¡ Fun fact: I've made one full clean website, but never uploaded because I'm a procrastiner.
(Please don't go on the old !!!)
