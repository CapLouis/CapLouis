- 🔭 I’m currently working on Python projects like one assembler interpreter and guis (some minor ones)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced CSS to improve my designs...

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've made one full clean website, but never uploaded because I'm a procrastinater.
- EDIT : it's online :p
(Please don't go on the old !!!)
