# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul, working on programming soups (not markups ;) ).

---

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Python projects like one assembler interpreter and guis (some minor ones)
PyNote is my latest project, one minimalistic text editor : [Source code]( https://github.com/Paul-Thorel/PyNote ) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced CSS to improve my designs..
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about your projects, I'll try helping you!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Check YouTube : TutoDev ...


- âš¡ Fun fact: I've made one full clean website, but never uploaded because I'm a procrastinater.
(Please don't go on the old !!!)
